    "# Problem Set 5b: Creating a Decision RNN (80 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will perform a simplified variant of the RNN analyses in Mante*, Sussillo* et al., Nature, 2013 (MS2013). You will train an RNN to perform evidence accumulation (a.k.a. integration), and visualize various features of your trained RNN. Specifically, you will train an RNN to output the running sum of a time-series stimulus input, mimicking the evidence accumulation computation that is central to many simple decision-making tasks. You will visualize the output of the trained RNN on one trial for each stimulus strength, and you will display the condition-averaged activity of a few of the RNN's hidden units. You will then visualize low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional hidden states of the RNN using PCA and a regression technique akin to Targeted Dimensionality Reduction from MS2013. These visualization techniques are a first step toward understanding how the RNN is representing information and performing computation."

    "### Part 1: Create the Synthetic Data (5 pts)\n",
    "First, create the data (inputs and target outputs) used to train the RNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the inputs, you will generate synthetic time-series stimuli, which represents the time-varying random dots stimuli from MS2013. The stimulus will be two-dimensional, one representing motion energy and the other representing the average color. For each of these two dimensions, you will generate time-series stimuli from univariate Gaussian distributions whose mean represents the corresponding stimulus strength. In a neuroscience experiment, these stimulus strengths might be referred to as \"conditions\" and would allow the experimenter to control the difficulty of each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw 40 trials of 25-timestep stimuli for each condition (200 trials total) from unit-variance Gaussians with condition-specific means of {-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1}. Each time step should be independent. You can use the `torch.randn` function to generate samples from a standard Gaussian and then shift by the corresponding mean. When finished, your stimuli should be a single Tensor with shape (200, 25, 2), where the first dimension is over trials, the second dimension is over timesteps, and the third dimension is over stimulus features (motion and color).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will generate a context cue, which indicates to the RNN whether the motion or the color signal is relevant for its decision in a given trial. For each trial, randomly assign the context cue to be either +1 or -1 (each with probability 0.5), indicating that the relevant stimulus is motion or color, respectively. To indicate a constant context cue within each trial, replicate the cue along the time dimension of a Tensor of shape (200, 25, 1). Concatenate this with the stimulus, so that you obtain a Tensor of shape (200, 25, 3). This will be the input to your RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, create the target outputs for the RNN. For each trial, create a running sum across the time dimension of the relevant stimulus (i.e., the motion dimension or the color dimension, depending on the context cue for that trial). The running sum represents the time-varying integrated evidence for each decision. You can compute the running sum with the `torch.cumsum` function. When finished, your target output should be a Tensor with shape (200, 25, 1)."
